# Joy Ride - Project Overview
A quick, simple project with code that controls a simulated car.

Part 1 - Drag Race: get a simulated car to jump over a grove of trees.<br />
Part 2 - Circular Track: get the car to drive around a circular track without falling off the edge. Explore the relationship between steering angle and turning radius.<br />
Part 3 - Parallel Park: successfully parallel park the car completely inside of the right lane without hitting any of the other cars.
